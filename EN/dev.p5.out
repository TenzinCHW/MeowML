When O
I O
called O
this O
morning O
#PUNCT# O
I O
didn't O
think O
I O
would O
be O
able O
to O
get O
in O
at O
#DIGIT# O
#PUNCT# O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
in O
#PUNCT# O
along O
with O
four O
other O
guests O
#PUNCT# O

The O
tuna B-positive
and O
wasabe O
potatoes I-positive
are O
excellent O
#PUNCT# O

My O
favortie O
pizza O
joint O
in O
Seattle O

Food B-positive
wise O
#PUNCT# O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place O
#PUNCT# O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the O
Beverly O
Center O
#PUNCT# O

My O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
I O
had O
that O
signature O
#PUNCT# O
MSG O
#PUNCT# O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
I O
left O
the O
restaurant O
#PUNCT# O

It's O
a O
tiny O
place O
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
#PUNCT# O
Thurs O
#PUNCT# O
Sun O
#PUNCT# O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi B-positive
bar O
#PUNCT# O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
wonderful O
and O
the O
food B-positive
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
recent O
trip O
to O
Italy O
#PUNCT# O

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood B-positive
restaurants O
in O
New O

#PUNCT# O

Believe O
it O
baby O
#PUNCT# O

We O
have O
since O
returned O
and O
also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
#PUNCT# O
sampling O
more O
small O

a O

Compared O

Ess-a O

#PUNCT# O

It O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
I O
did O
#PUNCT# O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
#PUNCT# O

the O
staff B-positive
was O
very O
nice O
and O
courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
#PUNCT# O

This O
was O
#PUNCT# O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
#PUNCT# O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
#PUNCT# O

I O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
#PUNCT# O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
#PUNCT# O

We O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu O
chocolate O
cake O
#PUNCT# O
both O
were O
delicious O
#PUNCT# O

Not O
much O

I O
wish O
this O

make O
a O

enough O

but O
Snooze O

a O

this O

#PUNCT# O

We've O

the O

what O

it O
#PUNCT# O

I O
literally O
just O

back O
home O
after O

it O
necessary O

#PUNCT# O

The O

so O
it O
was O
a O

not O

It's O

Single O
Worst O
Restaurant O
in O
Manhattan O

Inside O
is O
a O
little O
cramped O
#PUNCT# O
but O
to O
be O
expected O
#PUNCT# O

However O
#PUNCT# O
they O
do O
take O
your O

so O
that O
you O
can O
go O

out O
somewhere O

they O

Go O

or O
Spanish O

place O
#PUNCT# O
this O
creation O
in O

is O
a O
misstake O

Not O

#PUNCT# O
hence O
my O
lack O
of O
previous O

#PUNCT# O
#PUNCT# O
I O
called O
the O
restaurant O

up O
that O
their O
kitchen B-positive
might O
want O
to O
check O
the O
cleanliness O
of O
their O

#PUNCT# O

I'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place O
and O
this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O
#PUNCT# O

It's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant O
and O
it O
closes O

There O
is O
something O
about O

that O
makes O
me O
come O
back O
nearly O
every O

#PUNCT# O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food O
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
#PUNCT# O
and O
the O
spice O
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
#PUNCT# O

Quite O
frankly O
#PUNCT# O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi O
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
#PUNCT# O

If O
I O
could O
give O
#DIGIT# O

I O
would O
do O
so O
for O

I O

With O
the O

The O
rest O

#PUNCT# O
though O
pricey O
by O

#PUNCT# O
is O
worth O

modern O
Japanese O
brasserie I-positive
#PUNCT# O
that O

#PUNCT# O

in O
my O
opinion O
#PUNCT# O
one O
of O
the O
most O
romantic O
restaurants O
in O
the O
city O
#PUNCT# O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could've O
eaten O
several O
more O
#PUNCT# O
the O
portion O
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-positive
fries I-positive
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
#PUNCT# O

We O
asked O
for O

the O
waiter B-negative

admitted O
that O
he O
forgot O
to O
put O

that O

our O
order O
#PUNCT# O

I O
am O
bringing O
my O

back O
next O

These O

you O
can O
get O
better O
just O
around O

After O

the O
manager B-negative
grabbed O
my O

#PUNCT# O
asked O

maybe O
you O
dont O
